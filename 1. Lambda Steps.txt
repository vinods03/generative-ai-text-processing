Create lambda function - bedrockTextSummarizationFn.py - that invokes the Cohere text processing model.

The response which is a streaming body is converted into a python object and then required text is retrieved.

Test the lambda function by configuring the below key-value pair as a Test event:
{
  "prompt": "who is vinod"
}

Ensure lambda function has bedrock access.
