Another generative AI project using Amazon Bedrock, very similar to https://github.com/vinods03/generative-ai-image-generation, but this processes text rather than generating images.
The text processing can be text summarization or answering questions posed in the text etc.
The text processing is done by the model cohere.command-light-text-v14 provided by Cohere.
